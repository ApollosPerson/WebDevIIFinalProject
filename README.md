electron app for making and maintaining lists

also included reading and writing files from JSON. Reading and saving was accomplished, writing saved files back onto the app was not.
Add button on main screen still not working, but add button on menu does. Conversely, the open button on the menu does not work, however the open button on the app itself does. :/
